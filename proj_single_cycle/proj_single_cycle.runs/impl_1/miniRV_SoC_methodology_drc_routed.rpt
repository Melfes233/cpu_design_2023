TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT cpu_clk_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

There is a large setup violation of -1.759 ns between Core_cpu/u_PC/pc_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_cpuclk) and Core_cpu/u_RF/regs_reg_r1_0_31_24_29/RAMC_D1/I (clocked by clk_out1_cpuclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
